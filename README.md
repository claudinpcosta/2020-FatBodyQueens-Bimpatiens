# 2020-FatBodyQueens-Bimpatiens

## Contains all analyses performed on datasets for transcriptome analysis in the fat body of pre-overwintering bumble bee queens [(Costa et al. 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.15361)

### Synopsis

We used RNA sequencing to examine how age and nectar diet (specifically, the concentration of sucrose in nectar) impact gene expression in the pre-overwintering bumble bee queen fat body, the “liver-like” organ in insects with broad functions related to nutrient storage and metabolism.

_NOTES: Newly eclosed callow queens, which are less than 24 hr of age, were removed from their natal colonies and either collected immediately into liquid nitrogen (hereafter referred to as “0 day” group) or subjected to one of four diet treatments, where they were given 0%, 25%, 50% or 75% (w/v) sucrose solution; these are hereafter referred to as “sucrose solution” of various concentrations._


### Alignment details

In brief, the workflow:

````
1. Sequence data quality was evaluated using FASTQC;
2. Sequencing adapters and low quality bases were trimmed/filtered using Trimmomatic;
3. Reads were mapped to the B. impatiens v2.0 reference genome (Sadd et al. 2015) using HiSat2;
	 - Reference genome index was created using OGS annotation (splice sites & exons)
4. Exonic expression (read counts) was extracted and summed for genes using featureCount.

### Identification of differentially expressed genes

Differential gene expression was analysed using the DESeq2 package. The 0 day group was excluded from this factorial analysis because these queens were collected on the day of eclosion and did not receive a diet treatment. Expression data from the 0 day group were analysed for a subset of genes. Read counts were transformed using the variance stabilizing transformation with diet, age, colony, or age × diet as factors in the design for sample clustering and visualization of gene expression levels.

_see [DESEq2code.R](https://github.com/claudinpcosta/2020-FatBodyQueens-Bimpatiens/blob/master/DESEq2code.R) for the codes, and we can find the input in the folder [Data](https://github.com/claudinpcosta/2020-FatBodyQueens-Bimpatiens/tree/master/Data)_

### Gene Ontology enrichment analysis

We used GO enrichment analysis to explore gene functions that were overrepresented within the natal colony, age, diet and age × diet DEG lists. In brief:

````````
1.Coding sequences from our B. impatiens gene data set were matched to honey bee (A. mellifera) orthologues in the A. mellifera genome version 4.5 using a blastp reciprocal best match (E-value 1e−6), following the procedure used by Harpur et al. (2017);
2. Previously identified D. melanogaster orthologues were located for these A. mellifera genes in the Ensembl database (Zerbino et al., 2018);
3. Enrichment analysis of “complete” and “slim” GO terms (both biological processes and molecular functions terms) was performed using panther (http://pantherdb.org/tools/compareToRefList.jsp).

`````````

### Analysis of diapause-related gene expression

We also performed a molecular test of the hypothesis that age and diet mediate entry into diapause in bumble bee queens. For this, we performed a Fisher's exact test to identify whether there was a significant degree of overlap between:

_(a) genes differentially expressed between the B. impatiens queens in our study, at age 12 days and fed the 75% sucrose diet (12 days/75%) vs all other samples, and
(b) the B. terrestris queen diapause gene list from [Amsalem et al. (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.13410)_
